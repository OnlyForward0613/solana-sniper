## Strategy

1. Use Depth Data for Market Sentiment Analysis
    Bids and Asks Imbalance: Analyze the volume and number of bids versus asks to gauge market sentiment:
        -> A higher volume of bids might indicate buying pressure, suggesting an upward price movement.
        -> A higher volume of asks might indicate selling pressure, suggesting a downward price movement.

    Support and Resistance Levels: Identify key support and resistance levels based on the concentration of bids and asks.
    These levels can be crucial for setting stop-loss and take-profit points.


2. Incorporate Trade Data for Momentum and Volume Analysis
    * Trade Volume and Price Movement: Monitor trade volumes and their corresponding price changes to identify momentum.
        -> An increase in trade volume accompanied by a significant price movement can signal the strength of the trend.

    * Recent Trades Analysis: Evaluate the most recent trades for sudden changes in volume or price direction.
        -> This can provide early signs of market shifts that can be capitalized on in scalp trading.

3. Apply Rolling Window Data for Oscillator Calculations
    * Relative Strength Index (RSI): Calculate RSI using rolling window data to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
        -> Look for RSI levels below 30 (OVERSOLD) as a buying opportunity and above 70 (OVERBOUGHT) as a selling opportunity.

    * Moving Averages Convergence Divergence (MACD): Use rolling window data to calculate MACD.
        -> Look for signal line crossovers, MACD crossovers, and divergences with price to make trading decisions.

4. Combine Insights
    * Define Entry Points: Enter trades when depth data indicates strong support/resistance levels.
        -> Trade data shows momentum in the desired direction, and oscillators confirm market conditions (e.g., RSI is oversold for buys).

    * Define Exit Points: Set exit points based on resistance levels from depth data.
        -> A decrease in momentum as shown by trade data, and oscillator indications of overbought conditions or weakening trends.

    * Manage Risk: Use depth data to identify strong support and resistance levels for setting stop-loss orders.
        -> Adjust your position size based on the volatility indicated by trade and oscillator data to manage risk effectively.

## Oscillators:

1. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
   * Purpose: Measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
   * Relevance: Ideal for scalping as it can signal potential reversal points by indicating when a crypto asset is overbought (>70) or oversold (<30).
2. **Stochastic Oscillator**
   * Purpose: Compares a specific closing price of a crypto asset to a range of its prices over a certain period to identify momentum and trend reversal.
   * Relevance: Useful in scalping for spotting overbought/oversold conditions and potential price reversals, especially in a volatile market.
3. **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**
   * Purpose: Shows the relationship between two moving averages of a cryptocurrencyâ€™s price, indicating trend direction, momentum, and potential reversals.
   * Relevance: The MACD histogram's movements around the zero line can provide entry and exit signals for scalpers, with crossovers indicating trade opportunities.
4. **Awesome Oscillator (AO)**
   * Purpose: Measures market momentum to confirm trends or anticipate reversals by comparing the recent market momentum with the general momentum over a wider frame.
   * Relevance: Its zero-line crossovers and histogram peaks can offer scalpers insights into the strength of the market momentum and potential reversal points.
5. **Commodity Channel Index (CCI)**
   * Purpose: Determines the level of a price relative to its historical average, identifying cyclical trends.
   * Relevance: For scalping, values above +100 can indicate a strong uptrend (consider buying opportunities), while values below -100 suggest a strong downtrend (consider selling opportunities).
6. **Bollinger Bands**
   * Purpose: Not an oscillator in the traditional sense but acts as dynamic resistance and support levels based on price volatility.
   * Relevance: Scalpers can use the bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Price touching or crossing the bands may indicate potential entry or exit points.
